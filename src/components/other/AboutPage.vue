            The Ultimate RV application started out of a personal need to have a better
            route planning tool for trips with our RV. The objective was to have a mobile
            app that supports CarPlay. During the development, the need to have a web 
            application as well arrose. Taking our personal needs as an RVer into consideration,
            more and more features were added to aide the planning process for trips.
